# Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting time series data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model aims to predict future values based on historical data, making it suitable for various applications such as stock price prediction, weather forecasting, and more.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- **LSTM Model**: Implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps to clean and prepare time series data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations to understand data trends and model performance.
- **Customizable Forecasting**: Allows for adjusting the forecasting window and model parameters.
